The purpose of this program is to open
the url below and search the content
for the desired terms in my SearchTerms
tuple.If I can figure out how to return 
some context surrounding the search 
terms,like the paragraph they are in 
or the heading under which they appear,
that would be great.

The main purpose of creating this 
program is to help me learn how to do 
basic webscraping. 

Another important goal is to respect all 
legal and ethical guidelines related to 
webscraping, so please let me know if I 
have overlooked any of these.

This project is a sequel to my 
PracticeWebscraper project, which
was easier because it accessed an
API that organized its data into a
neat set of nested dictionaries.
